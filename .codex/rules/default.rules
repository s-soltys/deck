Then based on this the app loads card info from a well known API (images, card name, stats etc.) and for each card the app defines: the themed name, a description of the alternative themed image. Then based on this, the app generates a visual grid decklist (similar to apps like moxfield) and for each card it generates an alternative card image (by taking the original card and just pasting the newly generated image of the themed card over the area where the original card has its image and also by replacing the card name with the themed name).
