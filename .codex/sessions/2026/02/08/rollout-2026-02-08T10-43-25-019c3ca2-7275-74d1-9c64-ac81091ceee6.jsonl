Generate Functional Requirements\n       Each requirement must be testable\n       Use reasonable defaults for unspecified details (document assumptions in Assumptions section)\n    6. Define Success Criteria\n       Create measurable, technology-agnostic outcomes\n       Include both quantitative metrics (time, performance, volume) and qualitative measures (user satisfaction, task completion)\n       Each criterion must be verifiable without implementation details\n    7. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)\n    8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)\n\n5. Write the specification to SPEC_FILE using the template structure, replacing placeholders with concrete details derived from the feature description (arguments) while preserving section order and headings.\n\n6. **Specification Quality Validation**: After writing the initial spec, validate it against quality criteria:\n\n   a. **Create Spec Quality Checklist**: Generate a checklist file at `FEATURE_DIR/checklists/requirements.md` using the checklist template structure with these validation items:\n\n      ```markdown\n      # Specification Quality Checklist: [FEATURE NAME]\n      \n      **Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning\n      **Created**: [DATE]\n      **Feature**: [Link to spec.md]\n      \n      ## Content Quality\n      \n      - [ ] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)\n      - [ ] Focused on user value and business needs\n      - [ ] Written for non-technical stakeholders\n      - [ ] All mandatory sections completed\n      \n      ## Requirement Completeness\n      \n      - [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain\n      - [ ] Requirements are testable and unambiguous\n      - [ ] Success criteria are measurable\n      - [ ] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)\n      - [ ] All acceptance scenarios are defined\n      - [ ] Edge cases are identified\n      - [ ] Scope is clearly bounded\n      - [ ] Dependencies and assumptions identified\n      \n      ## Feature Readiness\n      \n      - [ ] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria\n      - [ ] User scenarios cover primary flows\n      - [ ] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria\n      - [ ] No implementation details leak into specification\n      \n      ## Notes\n      \n      - Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`\n      ```\n\n   b. **Run Validation Check**: Review the spec against each checklist item:\n      - For each item, determine if it passes or fails\n      - Document specific issues found (quote relevant spec sections)\n\n   c. **Handle Validation Results**:\n\n      - **If all items pass**: Mark checklist complete and proceed to step 6\n\n      - **If items fail (excluding [NEEDS CLARIFICATION])**:\n        1. List the failing items and specific issues\n        2. Update the spec to address each issue\n        3. Re-run validation until all items pass (max 3 iterations)\n        4. If still failing after 3 iterations, document remaining issues in checklist notes and warn user\n\n      - **If [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain**:\n        1. Extract all [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ...] markers from the spec\n        2. **LIMIT CHECK**: If more than 3 markers exist, keep only the 3 most critical (by scope/security/UX impact) and make informed guesses for the rest\n        3. For each clarification needed (max 3), present options to user in this format:\n\n           ```markdown\n           ## Question [N]: [Topic]\n           \n           **Context**: [Quote relevant spec section]\n           \n           **What we need to know**: [Specific question from NEEDS CLARIFICATION marker]\n           \n           **Suggested Answers**:\n           \n           | Option | Answer | Implications |\n           |--------|--------|--------------|\n           | A      | [First suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | B      | [Second suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | C      | [Third suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | Custom | Provide your own answer | [Explain how to provide custom input] |\n           \n           **Your choice**: _[Wait for user response]_\n           ```\n\n        4. **CRITICAL - Table Formatting**: Ensure markdown tables are properly formatted:\n           - Use consistent spacing with pipes aligned\n           - Each cell should have spaces around content: `| Content |` not `|Content|`\n           - Header separator must have at least 3 dashes: `|--------|`\n           - Test that the table renders correctly in markdown preview\n        5. Number questions sequentially (Q1, Q2, Q3 - max 3 total)\n        6. Present all questions together before waiting for responses\n        7. Wait for user to respond with their choices for all questions (e.g., \"Q1: A, Q2: Custom - [details], Q3: B\")\n        8. Update the spec by replacing each [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] marker with the user's selected or provided answer\n        9. Re-run validation after all clarifications are resolved\n\n   d. **Update Checklist**: After each validation iteration, update the checklist file with current pass/fail status\n\n7. Report completion with branch name, spec file path, checklist results, and readiness for the next phase (`/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`).\n\n**NOTE:** The script creates and checks out the new branch and initializes the spec file before writing.\n\n## General Guidelines\n\n## Quick Guidelines\n\n- Focus on **WHAT** users need and **WHY**.\n- Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure).\n- Written for business stakeholders, not developers.\n- DO NOT create any checklists that are embedded in the spec. That will be a separate command.\n\n### Section Requirements\n\n- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature\n- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature\n- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as \"N/A\")\n\n### For AI Generation\n\nWhen creating this spec from a user prompt:\n\n1. **Make informed guesses**: Use context, industry standards, and common patterns to fill gaps\n2. **Document assumptions**: Record reasonable defaults in the Assumptions section\n3. **Limit clarifications**: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - use only for critical decisions that:\n   - Significantly impact feature scope or user experience\n   - Have multiple reasonable interpretations with different implications\n   - Lack any reasonable default\n4. **Prioritize clarifications**: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details\n5. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the \"testable and unambiguous\" checklist item\n6. **Common areas needing clarification** (only if no reasonable default exists):\n   - Feature scope and boundaries (include/exclude specific use cases)\n   - User types and permissions (if multiple conflicting interpretations possible)\n   - Security/compliance requirements (when legally/financially significant)\n\n**Examples of reasonable defaults** (don't ask about these):\n\n- Data retention: Industry-standard practices for the domain\n- Performance targets: Standard web/mobile app expectations unless specified\n- Error handling: User-friendly messages with appropriate fallbacks\n- Authentication method: Standard session-based or OAuth2 for web apps\n- Integration patterns: RESTful APIs unless specified otherwise\n\n### Success Criteria Guidelines\n\nSuccess criteria must be:\n\n1. **Measurable**: Include specific metrics (time, percentage, count, rate)\n2. **Technology-agnostic**: No mention of frameworks, languages, databases, or tools\n3. **User-focused**: Describe outcomes from user/business perspective, not system internals\n4. **Verifiable**: Can be tested/validated without knowing implementation details\n\n**Good examples**:\n\n- \"Users can complete checkout in under 3 minutes\"\n- \"System supports 10,000 concurrent users\"\n- \"95% of searches return results in under 1 second\"\n- \"Task completion rate improves by 40%\"\n\n**Bad examples** (implementation-focused):\n\n- \"API response time is under 200ms\" (too technical, use \"Users see results instantly\")\n- \"Database can handle 1000 TPS\" (implementation detail, use user-facing metric)\n- \"React components render efficiently\" (framework-specific)\n- \"Redis cache hit rate above 80%\" (technology-specific)\n"}]}}

Load `.specify/templates/spec-template.md` to understand required sections.\n\n4. Follow this execution flow:\n\n    1. Parse user description from Input\n       If empty: ERROR \"No feature description provided\"\n    2. Extract key concepts from description\n       Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints\n    3. For unclear aspects:\n       - Make informed guesses based on context and industry standards\n       - Only mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] if:\n         - The choice significantly impacts feature scope or user experience\n         - Multiple reasonable interpretations exist with different implications\n         - No reasonable default exists\n       - **LIMIT: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers total**\n       - Prioritize clarifications by impact: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details\n    4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section\n       If no clear user flow: ERROR \"Cannot determine user scenarios\"\n    5. Generate Functional Requirements\n       Each requirement must be testable\n       Use reasonable defaults for unspecified details (document assumptions in Assumptions section)\n    6. Define Success Criteria\n       Create measurable, technology-agnostic outcomes\n       Include both quantitative metrics (time, performance, volume) and qualitative measures (user satisfaction, task completion)\n       Each criterion must be verifiable without implementation details\n    7. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)\n    8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)\n\n5. Write the specification to SPEC_FILE using the template structure, replacing placeholders with concrete details derived from the feature description (arguments) while preserving section order and headings.\n\n6. **Specification Quality Validation**: After writing the initial spec, validate it against quality criteria:\n\n   a. **Create Spec Quality Checklist**: Generate a checklist file at `FEATURE_DIR/checklists/requirements.md` using the checklist template structure with these validation items:\n\n      ```markdown\n      # Specification Quality Checklist: [FEATURE NAME]\n      \n      **Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning\n      **Created**: [DATE]\n      **Feature**: [Link to spec.md]\n      \n      ## Content Quality\n      \n      - [ ] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)\n      - [ ] Focused on user value and business needs\n      - [ ] Written for non-technical stakeholders\n      - [ ] All mandatory sections completed\n      \n      ## Requirement Completeness\n      \n      - [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain\n      - [ ] Requirements are testable and unambiguous\n      - [ ] Success criteria are measurable\n      - [ ] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)\n      - [ ] All acceptance scenarios are defined\n      - [ ] Edge cases are identified\n      - [ ] Scope is clearly bounded\n      - [ ] Dependencies and assumptions identified\n      \n      ## Feature Readiness\n      \n      - [ ] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria\n      - [ ] User scenarios cover primary flows\n      - [ ] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria\n      - [ ] No implementation details leak into specification\n      \n      ## Notes\n      \n      - Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`\n      ```\n\n   b. **Run Validation Check**: Review the spec against each checklist item:\n      - For each item, determine if it passes or fails\n      - Document specific issues found (quote relevant spec sections)\n\n   c. **Handle Validation Results**:\n\n      - **If all items pass**: Mark checklist complete and proceed to step 6\n\n      - **If items fail (excluding [NEEDS CLARIFICATION])**:\n        1. List the failing items and specific issues\n        2. Update the spec to address each issue\n        3. Re-run validation until all items pass (max 3 iterations)\n        4. If still failing after 3 iterations, document remaining issues in checklist notes and warn user\n\n      - **If [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain**:\n        1. Extract all [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ...] markers from the spec\n        2. **LIMIT CHECK**: If more than 3 markers exist, keep only the 3 most critical (by scope/security/UX impact) and make informed guesses for the rest\n        3. For each clarification needed (max 3), present options to user in this format:\n\n           ```markdown\n           ## Question [N]: [Topic]\n           \n           **Context**: [Quote relevant spec section]\n           \n           **What we need to know**: [Specific question from NEEDS CLARIFICATION marker]\n           \n           **Suggested Answers**:\n           \n           | Option | Answer | Implications |\n           |--------|--------|--------------|\n           | A      | [First suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | B      | [Second suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | C      | [Third suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |\n           | Custom | Provide your own answer | [Explain how to provide custom input] |\n           \n           **Your choice**: _[Wait for user response]_\n           ```\n\n        4. **CRITICAL - Table Formatting**: Ensure markdown tables are properly formatted:\n           - Use consistent spacing with pipes aligned\n           - Each cell should have spaces around content: `| Content |` not `|Content|`\n           - Header separator must have at least 3 dashes: `|--------|`\n           - Test that the table renders correctly in markdown preview\n        5. Number questions sequentially (Q1, Q2, Q3 - max 3 total)\n        6. Present all questions together before waiting for responses\n        7. Wait for user to respond with their choices for all questions (e.g., \"Q1: A, Q2: Custom - [details], Q3: B\")\n        8. Update the spec by replacing each [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] marker with the user's selected or provided answer\n        9. Re-run validation after all clarifications are resolved\n\n   d. **Update Checklist**: After each validation iteration, update the checklist file with current pass/fail status\n\n7. Report completion with branch name, spec file path, checklist results, and readiness for the next phase (`/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`).\n\n**NOTE:** The script creates and checks out the new branch and initializes the spec file before writing.\n\n## General Guidelines\n\n## Quick Guidelines\n\n- Focus on **WHAT** users need and **WHY**.\n- Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure).\n- Written for business stakeholders, not developers.\n- DO NOT create any checklists that are embedded in the spec. That will be a separate command.\n\n### Section Requirements\n\n- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature\n- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature\n- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as \"N/A\")\n\n### For AI Generation\n\nWhen creating this spec from a user prompt:\n\n1. **Make informed guesses**: Use context, industry standards, and common patterns to fill gaps\n2. **Document assumptions**: Record reasonable defaults in the Assumptions section\n3. **Limit clarifications**: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - use only for critical decisions that:\n   - Significantly impact feature scope or user experience\n   - Have multiple reasonable interpretations with different implications\n   - Lack any reasonable default\n4. **Prioritize clarifications**: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details\n5. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the \"testable and unambiguous\" checklist item\n6. **Common areas needing clarification** (only if no reasonable default exists):\n   - Feature scope and boundaries (include/exclude specific use cases)\n   - User types and permissions (if multiple conflicting interpretations possible)\n   - Security/compliance requirements (when legally/financially significant)\n\n**Examples of reasonable defaults** (don't ask about these):\n\n- Data retention: Industry-standard practices for the domain\n- Performance targets: Standard web/mobile app expectations unless specified\n- Error handling: User-friendly messages with appropriate fallbacks\n- Authentication method: Standard session-based or OAuth2 for web apps\n- Integration patterns: RESTful APIs unless specified otherwise\n\n### Success Criteria Guidelines\n\nSuccess criteria must be:\n\n1. **Measurable**: Include specific metrics (time, percentage, count, rate)\n2. **Technology-agnostic**: No mention of frameworks, languages, databases, or tools\n3. **User-focused**: Describe outcomes from user/business perspective, not system internals\n4. **Verifiable**: Can be tested/validated without knowing implementation details\n\n**Good examples**:\n\n- \"Users can complete checkout in under 3 minutes\"\n- \"System supports 10,000 concurrent users\"\n- \"95% of searches return results in under 1 second\"\n- \"Task completion rate improves by 40%\"\n\n**Bad examples** (implementation-focused):\n\n- \"API response time is under 200ms\" (too technical, use \"Users see results instantly\")\n- \"Database can handle 1000 TPS\" (implementation detail, use user-facing metric)\n- \"React components render efficiently\" (framework-specific)\n- \"Redis cache hit rate above 80%\" (technology-specific)\n","images":[]}}

Then based on this the app loads card info from a well known API (images, card name, stats etc.) and for each card the app defines: the themed name, a description of the alternative themed image. Then based on this, the app generates a visual grid decklist (similar to apps like moxfield) and for each card it generates an alternative card image (by taking the original card and just pasting the newly generated image of the themed card over the area where the original card has its image and also by replacing the card name with the themed name). There is no authentication in the first version.\\\"\\n\\n## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*\\n\\n### User Story 1 - Generate themed card list (Priority: P1)\\n\\nA player uploads a Commander decklist, describes a theme, and provides the themed commander name so they can get a complete themed card list with a themed name and themed art description for every card.\\n\\n**Why this priority**: It delivers the core value even without visual output and confirms the deck can be themed end-to-end.\\n\\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by submitting a 100-card decklist and a theme and verifying each card has a themed name and art description.\\n\\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\\n\\n1. **Given** a valid Commander decklist and a theme description, **When** the user submits them, **Then** every card returns with its original data plus a themed name and themed art description.\\n2. **Given** a decklist containing unknown or misspelled cards, **When** the user submits it, **Then** the system reports the unknown entries and continues processing known cards.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### User Story 2 - View themed deck grid (Priority: P2)\\n\\nA player views the themed deck as a visual grid so they can scan the deck similarly to common decklist tools.\\n\\n**Why this priority**: It turns the themed data into an immediately usable deck browsing experience.\\n\\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by generating a themed list and confirming the grid shows all cards with names and images.\\n\\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\\n\\n1. **Given** a completed themed card list, **When** the user opens the deck view, **Then** the system displays a grid of all cards with images and names.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### User Story 3 - Generate alternate card images (Priority: P3)\\n\\nA player generates alternate card images so each card shows the themed art and themed name on the card frame.\\n\\n**Why this priority**: It provides the final, shareable visual output for the themed deck.\\n\\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by generating alternate images for at least one card and verifying the themed art and name appear on the card.\\n\\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\\n\\n1. **Given** a completed themed card list, **When** the user requests alternate images, **Then** each card produces an alternate image that replaces the card art area and card name with the themed versions.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Edge Cases\\n\\n- What happens when the decklist is empty or does not meet Commander deck size rules?\\n- How does the system handle multiple copies of a card in the decklist?\\n- What happens when a card has multiple printings with different images?\\n- How does the system handle theme descriptions that are extremely short or empty?\\n- What happens when the card data source has missing image or stats data?\\n- How does the system handle long-running generation for large decks?\\n\\n## Requirements *(mandatory)*\\n\\n### Functional Requirements\\n\\n- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to submit a Commander decklist without creating an account.\\n- **FR-002**: System MUST allow users to provide a theme description and a themed commander name alongside the decklist.\\n- **FR-003**: System MUST parse decklists with quantities and produce a normalized list of cards and counts.\\n- **FR-004**: System MUST retrieve card names, images, and basic stats from a public card data source for each card in the decklist.\\n- **FR-005**: System MUST generate a themed name and a themed art description for every card in the decklist.\\n- **FR-006**: System MUST display a visual grid decklist that includes card images and names.\\n- **FR-007**: System MUST generate an alternate card image that replaces the card art area and card name with the themed versions.\\n- **FR-008**: System MUST surface clear error messages for cards that cannot be resolved and continue processing remaining cards.\\n\\n### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*\\n\\n- **Decklist**: User-submitted list of card names and quantities, plus format metadata.\\n- **Theme**: User-provided theme description and themed commander name.\\n- **Card**: Canonical card data including name, image, and basic stats.\\n- **Themed Card**: Card plus themed name and themed art description.\\n- **Alternate Image**: Visual output that applies themed art and name to the card frame.\\n\\n### Assumptions\\n\\n- Commander decklists are expected to contain 100 cards including the commander.\\n- Users provide decklists in a common text format with one card per line and optional quantities.\\n- The first version focuses on single-deck processing, not bulk imports or multi-deck management.\\n\\n## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*\\n\\n### Measurable Outcomes\\n\\n- **SC-001**: 90% of submitted Commander decklists result in a complete themed list with fewer than 5 unresolved cards.\\n- **SC-002**: 90% of users can complete a themed deck submission and view the themed list within 2 minutes.\\n- **SC-003**: For 90% of runs, a 100-card deck produces alternate images for at least 95 cards.\\n- **SC-004**: 80% of first-time users report they can understand the theme inputs and results without external help.\\nEOF\",\"workdir\":\"/Users/szymon/Documents/deck\",\"login\":false}","call_id":"call_MPbsetr5WWLibbq8B91VyrhV"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/szymon/Documents/deck/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/szymon/Documents/deck/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}

If the user explicitly states they are skipping clarification (e.g., exploratory spike), you may proceed, but must warn that downstream rework risk increases.\n\nExecution steps:\n\n1. Run `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --paths-only` from repo root **once** (combined `--json --paths-only` mode / `-Json -PathsOnly`). Parse minimal JSON payload fields:\n   - `FEATURE_DIR`\n   - `FEATURE_SPEC`\n   - (Optionally capture `IMPL_PLAN`, `TASKS` for future chained flows.)\n   - If JSON parsing fails, abort and instruct user to re-run `/speckit.specify` or verify feature branch environment.\n   - For single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\").\n\n2. Load the current spec file. Perform a structured ambiguity & coverage scan using this taxonomy. For each category, mark status: Clear / Partial / Missing. Produce an internal coverage map used for prioritization (do not output raw map unless no questions will be asked).\n\n   Functional Scope & Behavior:\n   - Core user goals & success criteria\n   - Explicit out-of-scope declarations\n   - User roles / personas differentiation\n\n   Domain & Data Model:\n   - Entities, attributes, relationships\n   - Identity & uniqueness rules\n   - Lifecycle/state transitions\n   - Data volume / scale assumptions\n\n   Interaction & UX Flow:\n   - Critical user journeys / sequences\n   - Error/empty/loading states\n   - Accessibility or localization notes\n\n   Non-Functional Quality Attributes:\n   - Performance (latency, throughput targets)\n   - Scalability (horizontal/vertical, limits)\n   - Reliability & availability (uptime, recovery expectations)\n   - Observability (logging, metrics, tracing signals)\n   - Security & privacy (authN/Z, data protection, threat assumptions)\n   - Compliance / regulatory constraints (if any)\n\n   Integration & External Dependencies:\n   - External services/APIs and failure modes\n   - Data import/export formats\n   - Protocol/versioning assumptions\n\n   Edge Cases & Failure Handling:\n   - Negative scenarios\n   - Rate limiting / throttling\n   - Conflict resolution (e.g., concurrent edits)\n\n   Constraints & Tradeoffs:\n   - Technical constraints (language, storage, hosting)\n   - Explicit tradeoffs or rejected alternatives\n\n   Terminology & Consistency:\n   - Canonical glossary terms\n   - Avoided synonyms / deprecated terms\n\n   Completion Signals:\n   - Acceptance criteria testability\n   - Measurable Definition of Done style indicators\n\n   Misc / Placeholders:\n   - TODO markers / unresolved decisions\n   - Ambiguous adjectives (\"robust\", \"intuitive\") lacking quantification\n\n   For each category with Partial or Missing status, add a candidate question opportunity unless:\n   - Clarification would not materially change implementation or validation strategy\n   - Information is better deferred to planning phase (note internally)\n\n3. Generate (internally) a prioritized queue of candidate clarification questions (maximum 5). Do NOT output them all at once. Apply these constraints:\n    - Maximum of 10 total questions across the whole session.\n    - Each question must be answerable with EITHER:\n       - A short multiple‑choice selection (2–5 distinct, mutually exclusive options), OR\n       - A one-word / short‑phrase answer (explicitly constrain: \"Answer in <=5 words\").\n    - Only include questions whose answers materially impact architecture, data modeling, task decomposition, test design, UX behavior, operational readiness, or compliance validation.\n    - Ensure category coverage balance: attempt to cover the highest impact unresolved categories first; avoid asking two low-impact questions when a single high-impact area (e.g., security posture) is unresolved.\n    - Exclude questions already answered, trivial stylistic preferences, or plan-level execution details (unless blocking correctness).\n    - Favor clarifications that reduce downstream rework risk or prevent misaligned acceptance tests.\n    - If more than 5 categories remain unresolved, select the top 5 by (Impact * Uncertainty) heuristic.\n\n4. Sequential questioning loop (interactive):\n    - Present EXACTLY ONE question at a time.\n    - For multiple‑choice questions:\n       - **Analyze all options** and determine the **most suitable option** based on:\n          - Best practices for the project type\n          - Common patterns in similar implementations\n          - Risk reduction (security, performance, maintainability)\n          - Alignment with any explicit project goals or constraints visible in the spec\n       - Present your **recommended option prominently** at the top with clear reasoning (1-2 sentences explaining why this is the best choice).\n       - Format as: `**Recommended:** Option [X] - <reasoning>`\n       - Then render all options as a Markdown table:\n\n       | Option | Description |\n       |--------|-------------|\n       | A | <Option A description> |\n       | B | <Option B description> |\n       | C | <Option C description> (add D/E as needed up to 5) |\n       | Short | Provide a different short answer (<=5 words) (Include only if free-form alternative is appropriate) |\n\n       - After the table, add: `You can reply with the option letter (e.g., \"A\"), accept the recommendation by saying \"yes\" or \"recommended\", or provide your own short answer.`\n    - For short‑answer style (no meaningful discrete options):\n       - Provide your **suggested answer** based on best practices and context.\n       - Format as: `**Suggested:** <your proposed answer> - <brief reasoning>`\n       - Then output: `Format: Short answer (<=5 words). You can accept the suggestion by saying \"yes\" or \"suggested\", or provide your own answer.`\n    - After the user answers:\n       - If the user replies with \"yes\", \"recommended\", or \"suggested\", use your previously stated recommendation/suggestion as the answer.\n       - Otherwise, validate the answer maps to one option or fits the <=5 word constraint.\n       - If ambiguous, ask for a quick disambiguation (count still belongs to same question; do not advance).\n       - Once satisfactory, record it in working memory (do not yet write to disk) and move to the next queued question.\n    - Stop asking further questions when:\n       - All critical ambiguities resolved early (remaining queued items become unnecessary), OR\n       - User signals completion (\"done\", \"good\", \"no more\"), OR\n       - You reach 5 asked questions.\n    - Never reveal future queued questions in advance.\n    - If no valid questions exist at start, immediately report no critical ambiguities.\n\n5. Integration after EACH accepted answer (incremental update approach):\n    - Maintain in-memory representation of the spec (loaded once at start) plus the raw file contents.\n    - For the first integrated answer in this session:\n       - Ensure a `## Clarifications` section exists (create it just after the highest-level contextual/overview section per the spec template if missing).\n       - Under it, create (if not present) a `### Session YYYY-MM-DD` subheading for today.\n    - Append a bullet line immediately after acceptance: `- Q: <question> → A: <final answer>`.\n    - Then immediately apply the clarification to the most appropriate section(s):\n       - Functional ambiguity → Update or add a bullet in Functional Requirements.\n       - User interaction / actor distinction → Update User Stories or Actors subsection (if present) with clarified role, constraint, or scenario.\n       - Data shape / entities → Update Data Model (add fields, types, relationships) preserving ordering; note added constraints succinctly.\n       - Non-functional constraint → Add/modify measurable criteria in Non-Functional / Quality Attributes section (convert vague adjective to metric or explicit target).\n       - Edge case / negative flow → Add a new bullet under Edge Cases / Error Handling (or create such subsection if template provides placeholder for it).\n       - Terminology conflict → Normalize term across spec; retain original only if necessary by adding `(formerly referred to as \"X\")` once.\n    - If the clarification invalidates an earlier ambiguous statement, replace that statement instead of duplicating; leave no obsolete contradictory text.\n    - Save the spec file AFTER each integration to minimize risk of context loss (atomic overwrite).\n    - Preserve formatting: do not reorder unrelated sections; keep heading hierarchy intact.\n    - Keep each inserted clarification minimal and testable (avoid narrative drift).\n\n6.

If the user explicitly states they are skipping clarification (e.g., exploratory spike), you may proceed, but must warn that downstream rework risk increases.\n\nExecution steps:\n\n1. Run `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --paths-only` from repo root **once** (combined `--json --paths-only` mode / `-Json -PathsOnly`). Parse minimal JSON payload fields:\n   - `FEATURE_DIR`\n   - `FEATURE_SPEC`\n   - (Optionally capture `IMPL_PLAN`, `TASKS` for future chained flows.)\n   - If JSON parsing fails, abort and instruct user to re-run `/speckit.specify` or verify feature branch environment.\n   - For single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\").\n\n2. Load the current spec file. Perform a structured ambiguity & coverage scan using this taxonomy. For each category, mark status: Clear / Partial / Missing. Produce an internal coverage map used for prioritization (do not output raw map unless no questions will be asked).\n\n   Functional Scope & Behavior:\n   - Core user goals & success criteria\n   - Explicit out-of-scope declarations\n   - User roles / personas differentiation\n\n   Domain & Data Model:\n   - Entities, attributes, relationships\n   - Identity & uniqueness rules\n   - Lifecycle/state transitions\n   - Data volume / scale assumptions\n\n   Interaction & UX Flow:\n   - Critical user journeys / sequences\n   - Error/empty/loading states\n   - Accessibility or localization notes\n\n   Non-Functional Quality Attributes:\n   - Performance (latency, throughput targets)\n   - Scalability (horizontal/vertical, limits)\n   - Reliability & availability (uptime, recovery expectations)\n   - Observability (logging, metrics, tracing signals)\n   - Security & privacy (authN/Z, data protection, threat assumptions)\n   - Compliance / regulatory constraints (if any)\n\n   Integration & External Dependencies:\n   - External services/APIs and failure modes\n   - Data import/export formats\n   - Protocol/versioning assumptions\n\n   Edge Cases & Failure Handling:\n   - Negative scenarios\n   - Rate limiting / throttling\n   - Conflict resolution (e.g., concurrent edits)\n\n   Constraints & Tradeoffs:\n   - Technical constraints (language, storage, hosting)\n   - Explicit tradeoffs or rejected alternatives\n\n   Terminology & Consistency:\n   - Canonical glossary terms\n   - Avoided synonyms / deprecated terms\n\n   Completion Signals:\n   - Acceptance criteria testability\n   - Measurable Definition of Done style indicators\n\n   Misc / Placeholders:\n   - TODO markers / unresolved decisions\n   - Ambiguous adjectives (\"robust\", \"intuitive\") lacking quantification\n\n   For each category with Partial or Missing status, add a candidate question opportunity unless:\n   - Clarification would not materially change implementation or validation strategy\n   - Information is better deferred to planning phase (note internally)\n\n3. Generate (internally) a prioritized queue of candidate clarification questions (maximum 5). Do NOT output them all at once. Apply these constraints:\n    - Maximum of 10 total questions across the whole session.\n    - Each question must be answerable with EITHER:\n       - A short multiple‑choice selection (2–5 distinct, mutually exclusive options), OR\n       - A one-word / short‑phrase answer (explicitly constrain: \"Answer in <=5 words\").\n    - Only include questions whose answers materially impact architecture, data modeling, task decomposition, test design, UX behavior, operational readiness, or compliance validation.\n    - Ensure category coverage balance: attempt to cover the highest impact unresolved categories first; avoid asking two low-impact questions when a single high-impact area (e.g., security posture) is unresolved.\n    - Exclude questions already answered, trivial stylistic preferences, or plan-level execution details (unless blocking correctness).\n    - Favor clarifications that reduce downstream rework risk or prevent misaligned acceptance tests.\n    - If more than 5 categories remain unresolved, select the top 5 by (Impact * Uncertainty) heuristic.\n\n4. Sequential questioning loop (interactive):\n    - Present EXACTLY ONE question at a time.\n    - For multiple‑choice questions:\n       - **Analyze all options** and determine the **most suitable option** based on:\n          - Best practices for the project type\n          - Common patterns in similar implementations\n          - Risk reduction (security, performance, maintainability)\n          - Alignment with any explicit project goals or constraints visible in the spec\n       - Present your **recommended option prominently** at the top with clear reasoning (1-2 sentences explaining why this is the best choice).\n       - Format as: `**Recommended:** Option [X] - <reasoning>`\n       - Then render all options as a Markdown table:\n\n       | Option | Description |\n       |--------|-------------|\n       | A | <Option A description> |\n       | B | <Option B description> |\n       | C | <Option C description> (add D/E as needed up to 5) |\n       | Short | Provide a different short answer (<=5 words) (Include only if free-form alternative is appropriate) |\n\n       - After the table, add: `You can reply with the option letter (e.g., \"A\"), accept the recommendation by saying \"yes\" or \"recommended\", or provide your own short answer.`\n    - For short‑answer style (no meaningful discrete options):\n       - Provide your **suggested answer** based on best practices and context.\n       - Format as: `**Suggested:** <your proposed answer> - <brief reasoning>`\n       - Then output: `Format: Short answer (<=5 words). You can accept the suggestion by saying \"yes\" or \"suggested\", or provide your own answer.`\n    - After the user answers:\n       - If the user replies with \"yes\", \"recommended\", or \"suggested\", use your previously stated recommendation/suggestion as the answer.\n       - Otherwise, validate the answer maps to one option or fits the <=5 word constraint.\n       - If ambiguous, ask for a quick disambiguation (count still belongs to same question; do not advance).\n       - Once satisfactory, record it in working memory (do not yet write to disk) and move to the next queued question.\n    - Stop asking further questions when:\n       - All critical ambiguities resolved early (remaining queued items become unnecessary), OR\n       - User signals completion (\"done\", \"good\", \"no more\"), OR\n       - You reach 5 asked questions.\n    - Never reveal future queued questions in advance.\n    - If no valid questions exist at start, immediately report no critical ambiguities.\n\n5. Integration after EACH accepted answer (incremental update approach):\n    - Maintain in-memory representation of the spec (loaded once at start) plus the raw file contents.\n    - For the first integrated answer in this session:\n       - Ensure a `## Clarifications` section exists (create it just after the highest-level contextual/overview section per the spec template if missing).\n       - Under it, create (if not present) a `### Session YYYY-MM-DD` subheading for today.\n    - Append a bullet line immediately after acceptance: `- Q: <question> → A: <final answer>`.\n    - Then immediately apply the clarification to the most appropriate section(s):\n       - Functional ambiguity → Update or add a bullet in Functional Requirements.\n       - User interaction / actor distinction → Update User Stories or Actors subsection (if present) with clarified role, constraint, or scenario.\n       - Data shape / entities → Update Data Model (add fields, types, relationships) preserving ordering; note added constraints succinctly.\n       - Non-functional constraint → Add/modify measurable criteria in Non-Functional / Quality Attributes section (convert vague adjective to metric or explicit target).\n       - Edge case / negative flow → Add a new bullet under Edge Cases / Error Handling (or create such subsection if template provides placeholder for it).\n       - Terminology conflict → Normalize term across spec; retain original only if necessary by adding `(formerly referred to as \"X\")` once.\n    - If the clarification invalidates an earlier ambiguous statement, replace that statement instead of duplicating; leave no obsolete contradictory text.\n    - Save the spec file AFTER each integration to minimize risk of context loss (atomic overwrite).\n    - Preserve formatting: do not reorder unrelated sections; keep heading hierarchy intact.\n    - Keep each inserted clarification minimal and testable (avoid narrative drift).\n\n6. Validation (performed after EACH write plus final pass):\n   - Clarifications session contains exactly one bullet per accepted answer (no duplicates).\n   - Total asked (accepted) questions ≤ 5.\n   - Updated sections contain no lingering vague placeholders the new answer was meant to resolve.\n   - No contradictory earlier statement remains (scan for now-invalid alternative choices removed).\n   - Markdown structure valid; only allowed new headings: `## Clarifications`, `### Session YYYY-MM-DD`.\n   - Terminology consistency: same canonical term used across all updated sections.\n\n7.

Then based on this the app loads card info from a well known API (images, card name, stats etc.) and for each card the app defines: the themed name, a description of the alternative themed image. Then based on this, the app generates a visual grid decklist (similar to apps like moxfield) and for each card it generates an alternative card image (by taking the original card and just pasting the newly generated image of the themed card over the area where the original card has its image and also by replacing the card name with the themed name). There is no authentication in the first version.\"\n\n## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*\n\n### User Story 1 - Generate themed card list (Priority: P1)\n\nA player uploads a Commander decklist, describes a theme, and provides the themed commander name so they can get a complete themed card list with a themed name and themed art description for every card.\n\n**Why this priority**: It delivers the core value even without visual output and confirms the deck can be themed end-to-end.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by submitting a 100-card decklist and a theme and verifying each card has a themed name and art description.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a valid Commander decklist and a theme description, **When** the user submits them, **Then** every card returns with its original data plus a themed name and themed art description.\n2. **Given** a decklist containing unknown or misspelled cards, **When** the user submits it, **Then** the system reports the unknown entries and continues processing known cards.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 2 - View themed deck grid (Priority: P2)\n\nA player views the themed deck as a visual grid so they can scan the deck similarly to common decklist tools.\n\n**Why this priority**: It turns the themed data into an immediately usable deck browsing experience.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by generating a themed list and confirming the grid shows all cards with names and images.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a completed themed card list, **When** the user opens the deck view, **Then** the system displays a grid of all cards with images and names.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 3 - Generate alternate card images (Priority: P3)\n\nA player generates alternate card images so each card shows the themed art and themed name on the card frame.\n\n**Why this priority**: It provides the final, shareable visual output for the themed deck.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by generating alternate images for at least one card and verifying the themed art and name appear on the card.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a completed themed card list, **When** the user requests alternate images, **Then** each card produces an alternate image that replaces the card art area and card name with the themed versions.\n\n---\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- What happens when the decklist is empty or does not meet Commander deck size rules?\n- How does the system handle multiple copies of a card in the decklist?\n- What happens when a card has multiple printings with different images?\n- How does the system handle theme descriptions that are extremely short or empty?\n- What happens when the card data source has missing image or stats data?\n- How does the system handle long-running generation for large decks?\n\n## Requirements *(mandatory)*\n\n### Functional Requirements\n\n- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to submit a Commander decklist without creating an account.\n- **FR-002**: System MUST allow users to provide a theme description and a themed commander name alongside the decklist.\n- **FR-003**: System MUST parse decklists with quantities and produce a normalized list of cards and counts.\n- **FR-004**: System MUST retrieve card names, images, and basic stats from a public card data source for each card in the decklist.\n- **FR-005**: System MUST generate a themed name and a themed art description for every card in the decklist.\n- **FR-006**: System MUST display a visual grid decklist that includes card images and names.\n- **FR-007**: System MUST generate an alternate card image that replaces the card art area and card name with the themed versions.\n- **FR-008**: System MUST surface clear error messages for cards that cannot be resolved and continue processing remaining cards.\n\n### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*\n\n- **Decklist**: User-submitted list of card names and quantities, plus format metadata.\n- **Theme**: User-provided theme description and themed commander name.\n- **Card**: Canonical card data including name, image, and basic stats.\n- **Themed Card**: Card plus themed name and themed art description.\n- **Alternate Image**: Visual output that applies themed art and name to the card frame.\n\n### Assumptions\n\n- Commander decklists are expected to contain 100 cards including the commander.\n- Users provide decklists in a common text format with one card per line and optional quantities.\n- The first version focuses on single-deck processing, not bulk imports or multi-deck management.\n\n### Dependencies\n\n- Access to a public card data source that provides card images and basic stats.\n- Ability to produce themed art assets from the provided theme description.\n\n## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*\n\n### Measurable Outcomes\n\n- **SC-001**: 90% of submitted Commander decklists result in a complete themed list with fewer than 5 unresolved cards.\n- **SC-002**: 90% of users can complete a themed deck submission and view the themed list within 2 minutes.\n- **SC-003**: For 90% of runs, a 100-card deck produces alternate images for at least 95 cards.\n- **SC-004**: 80% of first-time users report they can understand the theme inputs and results without external help.\n"}}

Then based on this the app loads card info from a well known API (images, card name, stats etc.) and for each card the app defines: the themed name, a description of the alternative themed image. Then based on this, the app generates a visual grid decklist (similar to apps like moxfield) and for each card it generates an alternative card image (by taking the original card and just pasting the newly generated image of the themed card over the area where the original card has its image and also by replacing the card name with the themed name).

Then based on this the app loads card info from a well known API (images, card name, stats etc.) and for each card the app defines: the themed name, a description of the alternative themed image. Then based on this, the app generates a visual grid decklist (similar to apps like moxfield) and for each card it generates an alternative card image (by taking the original card and just pasting the newly generated image of the themed card over the area where the original card has its image and also by replacing the card name with the themed name). There is no authentication in the first version.\"\n\n## Clarifications\n\n### Session 2026-02-08\n\n- Q: Which decklist input format should be supported for upload? → A: Plain text list with one card per line and optional quantity.\n- Q: Which card printing should be used when multiple images exist? → A: Most recent regular printing.\n- Q: Are there theme content restrictions? → A: Any theme allowed; user is responsible for rights.\n- Q: Should results be persisted for later access? → A: Persistent saved deck with public URL.\n- Q: How should missing card data be handled? → A: Continue and mark missing cards.\n\n## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*\n\n### User Story 1 - Generate themed card list (Priority: P1)\n\nA player uploads a Commander decklist, describes a theme, and provides the themed commander name so they can get a complete themed card list with a themed name and themed art description for every card.\n\n**Why this priority**: It delivers the core value even without visual output and confirms the deck can be themed end-to-end.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by submitting a 100-card decklist and a theme and verifying each card has a themed name and art description.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a valid Commander decklist and a theme description, **When** the user submits them, **Then** every card returns with its original data plus a themed name and themed art description.\n2. **Given** a decklist containing unknown or misspelled cards, **When** the user submits it, **Then** the system reports the unknown entries and continues processing known cards.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 2 - View themed deck grid (Priority: P2)\n\nA player views the themed deck as a visual grid so they can scan the deck similarly to common decklist tools.\n\n**Why this priority**: It turns the themed data into an immediately usable deck browsing experience.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by generating a themed list and confirming the grid shows all cards with names and images.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a completed themed card list, **When** the user opens the deck view, **Then** the system displays a grid of all cards with images and names.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 3 - Generate alternate card images (Priority: P3)\n\nA player generates alternate card images so each card shows the themed art and themed name on the card frame.\n\n**Why this priority**: It provides the final, shareable visual output for the themed deck.\n\n**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by generating alternate images for at least one card and verifying the themed art and name appear on the card.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a completed themed card list, **When** the user requests alternate images, **Then** each card produces an alternate image that replaces the card art area and card name with the themed versions.\n\n---\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- What happens when the decklist is empty or does not meet Commander deck size rules?\n- How does the system handle multiple copies of a card in the decklist?\n- What happens when a card has multiple printings with different images?\n- How does the system handle theme descriptions that are extremely short or empty?\n- What happens when the card data source has missing image or stats data?\n- How does the system handle long-running generation for large decks?\n- What happens when a decklist line is malformed or missing a card name?\n- What happens when a card’s “legendary” status is unclear or missing in card data?\n- What happens when the selected printing lacks an image?\n\n## Requirements *(mandatory)*\n\n### Functional Requirements\n\n- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to submit a Commander decklist without creating an account.\n- **FR-002**: System MUST allow users to provide a theme description and a themed commander name alongside the decklist.\n- **FR-003**: System MUST accept plain text decklists with one card per line and optional quantities and parse them into a normalized list of cards and counts.\n- **FR-004**: System MUST retrieve card names, images, and basic stats from a public card data source for each card in the decklist.\n- **FR-004a**: System MUST select the most recent regular printing when multiple images exist for a card.\n- **FR-005**: System MUST generate a themed name and a themed art description for every card in the decklist.\n- **FR-006**: System MUST display a visual grid decklist that includes card images and names.\n- **FR-007**: System MUST generate an alternate card image that replaces the card art area and card name with the themed versions.\n- **FR-008**: System MUST surface clear error messages for cards that cannot be resolved and continue processing remaining cards.\n- **FR-009**: System MUST allow any theme content and display a notice that users are responsible for usage rights.\n- **FR-010**: System MUST persist generated decks and provide a public URL for later access without authentication.\n- **FR-011**: System MUST mark any unresolved cards in the results rather than failing the entire run.\n- **FR-012**: System MUST preserve legendary status in themed names (legendary cards become named characters, and non-legendary cards do not become named characters).\n- **FR-013**: System MUST keep the names of basic lands unchanged in the themed output.\n- **FR-014**: System MUST align themed versions with the source card’s character or role (for example, defensive cards map to defensive-themed counterparts).\n- **FR-015**: System MUST keep themed naming and imagery aligned with the card’s color identity.\n- **FR-016**: System MUST preserve card type framing in the theme (creatures remain creatures, spells remain spell effects, and artifacts remain objects).\n- **FR-017**: System MUST preserve core creature type identity where it materially defines the card (for example, Dragons remain large mythic creatures).\n- **FR-018**: System MUST treat planeswalkers as singular named characters in the theme.\n- **FR-019**: System MUST keep equipment, auras, and vehicles framed as items, effects, and conveyances respectively, not characters.\n\n### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*\n\n- **Decklist**: User-submitted list of card names and quantities, plus format metadata.\n- **Theme**: User-provided theme description and themed commander name.\n- **Card**: Canonical card data including name, image, and basic stats.\n- **Themed Card**: Card plus themed name and themed art description.\n- **Alternate Image**: Visual output that applies themed art and name to the card frame.\n\n### Assumptions\n\n- Commander decklists are expected to contain 100 cards including the commander.\n- Users provide decklists as plain text with one card per line and optional quantities.\n- The first version focuses on single-deck processing, not bulk imports or multi-deck management by the same user.\n\n### Dependencies\n\n- Access to a public card data source that provides card images and basic stats.\n- Ability to produce themed art assets from the provided theme description.\n\n## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*\n\n### Measurable Outcomes\n\n- **SC-001**: 90% of submitted Commander decklists result in a complete themed list with fewer than 5 unresolved cards.\n- **SC-002**: 90% of users can complete a themed deck submission and view the themed list within 2 minutes.\n- **SC-003**: For 90% of runs, a 100-card deck produces alternate images for at least 95 cards.\n- **SC-004**: 80% of first-time users report they can understand the theme inputs and results without external help.\n"}}

Below is the list of skills that can be used. Each entry includes a name, description, and file path so you can open the source for full instructions when using a specific skill.\n### Available skills\n- skill-creator: Guide for creating effective skills. This skill should be used when users want to create a new skill (or update an existing skill) that extends Codex's capabilities with specialized knowledge, workflows, or tool integrations. (file: /Users/szymon/Documents/deck/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/SKILL.md)\n- skill-installer: Install Codex skills into $CODEX_HOME/skills from a curated list or a GitHub repo path. Use when a user asks to list installable skills, install a curated skill, or install a skill from another repo (including private repos). (file: /Users/szymon/Documents/deck/.codex/skills/.system/skill-installer/SKILL.md)\n### How to use skills\n- Discovery: The list above is the skills available in this session (name + description + file path). Skill bodies live on disk at the listed paths.\n- Trigger rules: If the user names a skill (with `$SkillName` or plain text) OR the task clearly matches a skill's description shown above, you must use that skill for that turn. Multiple mentions mean use them all. Do not carry skills across turns unless re-mentioned.\n- Missing/blocked: If a named skill isn't in the list or the path can't be read, say so briefly and continue with the best fallback.\n- How to use a skill (progressive disclosure):\n  1) After deciding to use a skill, open its `SKILL.md`. Read only enough to follow the workflow.\n  2) If `SKILL.md` points to extra folders such as `references/`, load only the specific files needed for the request; don't bulk-load everything.\n  3) If `scripts/` exist, prefer running or patching them instead of retyping large code blocks.\n  4) If `assets/` or templates exist, reuse them instead of recreating from scratch.\n- Coordination and sequencing:\n  - If multiple skills apply, choose the minimal set that covers the request and state the order you'll use them.\n  - Announce which skill(s) you're using and why (one short line). If you skip an obvious skill, say why.\n- Context hygiene:\n  - Keep context small: summarize long sections instead of pasting them; only load extra files when needed.\n  - Avoid deep reference-chasing: prefer opening only files directly linked from `SKILL.md` unless you're blocked.\n  - When variants exist (frameworks, providers, domains), pick only the relevant reference file(s) and note that choice.\n- Safety and fallback: If a skill can't be applied cleanly (missing files, unclear instructions), state the issue, pick the next-best approach, and continue.","truncation_policy":{"mode":"tokens","limit":10000}}}
